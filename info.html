<h1>From the author</h1>
<p>Hello, this is the place where I put, organize and share my writings. It could be any notes, thoughts, plans etc., und could be of English (since I want to practice it) or German (which I currently use mostly).</p>
<p>Chinese is my mother tongue, I use it quite a lot, but it's not very convenient to write Chinese into my codes at the moment so that I won't use it a lot here. </p>
<p>This website of mine presents only some of the most basic web functions, I'll try to make it better. And here, in this Page, shows its recent improvements: Any thoughts, any ideas or new changes about this website will be recorded here.</p>
<p>I hope you will like my website and have fun with surfing in my world.</p>
<p>Your Jing</p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<h1>Hi there,</h1><p>I am JL, I've opened this website today, 20th April 2020. I named it "library", because I happened to capture a nice photo of a <em>library</em> on my way home, an hour ago-- I like this photo very much, the weather was so good. Since I didn't know which name should my new website get, I simply grasped the word on this photo: Bibliothek, in English means: library.
</p>
<p>I'll show you this photo later.
</p>
<p>Well, funny name, isn't it? Funny the way you write these words, too-- you might say. Strange people who's created a strange website, write some stupid things here.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">It's not about a library really, I've got no idea what am I going to write, nor what this stuff is going to look like.. It's nothing important, though.
For me it's one of my projekts; a place to kill time; where I can use some English (or any other freak languages), write some sort of public diaries or anything, practice some newly learned programming skills and so on.
</p>
<p>And this time it would be a simple website, as simple as it could be. Simple and unique. (Hauptsache, einfach für mich zu schreiben und für andere zu lesen. Is that not a great idea?)
</p>
<p>Of course there could also be things that no one could unterstand, too. Why not? That's funny as well. I'm just going to write whatever I like. Perhaps I'll let everybody be able to do that here, too.
</p>
<p>I suppose you would keep reading, right?
</p>
