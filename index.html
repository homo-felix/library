<h1>Hi,
</h1>
<p>my name is Jing Li, I've opened this website today, 20th April 2020. I named it "library", because I happened to captured a nice photo on my way home, an hour earlier-- I like this photo very much, the weather is so good. And it was taken near the city library in Hennigsdorf. Since I don't know which name should my new website get, I simply grasped the word on this photo: Bibliothek, in English means: library.
</p>
<p>I'll show you this photo later.
</p>
<p>Well, funny name, isn't it? Funny the way you write these words, too-- you might say. Strange people who's create a strange website, write some stupid things there.
</p>
<p> No
